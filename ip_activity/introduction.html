      <h2> Introduction </h2>
      <p class="text">
         This interface is used for visualising IP address activity.
         It contains interactive elements using AJAX technology, so that the page
         can change dynamically based on user's request without reloading the page.
      </p>

      <p class="text">
         In order to run properly, the used browser needs <strong>JavaScript</strong> enabled.<br>
         All .html and .css files have been validated by <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">W3C Validator</a>.
      </p>

      <h2> Guide </h2>
         <p class="text">
            This section contains guide for main operations and offers the description of the main page sections.
         </p>
      <h3>Initialisation</h3>
      <p class="text"> 
         The interface is provided by a custom web server, also created for the purposes of this
         project. Therefore, the activity of the interface is dependent on the server state.
         In order to interact with the interface, the web server has to be set up and listening
         on the defined port.
      </p>
      <h3>Available Information</h3>
      <p class="text"> 
         The page is divided in two parts. The top part is intended for visualising data
         of the whole specified address space during the whole time window. The bottom part is
         hidden until the user selects an area they want to examine further. It contains
         information about the specified area and the image visualising the area activity is
         automatically scaled.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
         The parameters of the stored IP activity is available in <strong>Characteristics</strong> section.
         In order to get activity status of a specific cell, the user can hover over the
         image which will update the coordinates' values in the <strong>Current Position</strong> section.
      </p>
      <h3>Activity Status</h3>
      <p class="text">Activity status of all IPs can be determined by a distinctive colour at the chosen coordinates. The
      used colours are defined as follows:</p>
      <ul>
         <li><strong>black</strong>: During the given interval, the IP address was inactive.</li>
         <li><strong>white</strong>: During the given interval, the IP address was active.</li>
         <li><strong>gray</strong>: There is no information about activity for the given interval or address.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Area Selection</h3>
      <p class="text">
         The user can select an area for detail examination by choosing both value ranges and submitting the form in the
         <strong>Select Bitmap Area</strong> section.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
         The first way is the manual way. The user can type the selected ranges to the form.
         It is useful when the user knows the area they want to display separately.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
         The second way is used for examining the visualised activity based on an interesting pattern found in the image. Instead of having to
         find out the minimum and maximum values in both dimensions limiting the area, the user can simply drag the cursor and select
         the area by enclosing it within the displayed frame. The frame size changes based on the cursor direction. When the selection is done,
         the values of both ranges are automatically inserted in the form.
      </p>

      <h2>Project Details</h2>
      <p class="text">
         This interface is a part of bachelor's thesis <strong>IP Address Activity Monitoring</strong>
         at Brno University of Technology, Faculty of Information Technology, in 2016.
         The project was created in cooperation with CESNET company.
